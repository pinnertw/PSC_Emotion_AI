# PSC_Emotion_AI

Our team project "Emotion AI" consisted in designing an artificial intelligence software, capable of predicting the emotion felt by a gamer wearing a virtual reality gear. 
Our input data to predict emotion came from sensors located inside the virtual reality headset. 
This research topic was proposed to us by Accenture Labs, which lent us the virtual reality headset \textit{HTC Vive Pro}.
